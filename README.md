# Secure Hybrid Network Lab (Azure + Python SDK)
> **Secure Hybrid Network Lab** is a hands-on, automated project that simulates a hybrid cloud environment by connecting a local (on-premises) VM to an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) using a site-to-site VPN Gateway.  
All Azure resources are deployed and managed using the official **Azure Python SDK**, with teardown scripts for full lifecycle management.  
This project is designed to build and demonstrate real-world skills for cloud support and sysadmin roles, with a focus on secure networking, automation, and troubleshooting.
